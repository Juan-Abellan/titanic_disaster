# titanic_disaster

## Background & Objectives

We will explore the Titanic disaster data set.

Here are some interesting points to explore:

- Let’s get familiar with the dataset (import, head, describe, read column name description…)
- Let’s remove the cabin from the dataset because we don’t have enough data about the cabin number (cleaning a dataset)
- Find out if a first class ticket increased your chances of survival.
- Here it’s a simple comparison between the rate of survival of the passenger by ticket type
- Find out if more children and women were saved.
- Here compare the survival rate of [‘Men’, ‘Children’, ‘Women’])

Optional

- Find out if it was harder for bigger families to survive?
- Were passengers with distinguished titles preferred during the evacuation?

## Data
we will explore the famous Titanic dataset listing all passengers with various properties.

## Tools
For this challenge, we will work with Jypiter Notebook and some Python libraries such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
